<p>My husband and I live in the wonderful city of Austin, TX. We got married on February 2, 2013 and are learning how to do life as a married couple for the glory of Christ. We love being outside, biking, good beer, great friends, and family. My husband is a software engineer and loves what he does. I am currently a  stay at home wife figuring out what the next step is for me. I love trying to DIY projects, and staying organized. More than any of those things we want to live every moment of life for Christ's glory because we believe that He has saved us from sin and death once and for all.</p>
<p>"<sup>21 </sup>And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, <sup>22 </sup>he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him, <sup>23 </sup>if indeed you continue in the faith,stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister." Colossians 1:21-23</p>
