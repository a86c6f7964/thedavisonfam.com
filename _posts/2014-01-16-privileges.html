<p>I’ve read this no less than 20 times over the past few days. I keep thinking that I want to write about it, but every time I sit down to write about it I realize that there are no other words to express how I am feeling, or what I am thinking than these very words. How great are my privileges in Jesus. Praise be to thee for grace, and for the UNSPEAKABLE gift of Jesus.</p>
<p>Privileges<br />
(from Valley of Vision)</p>
<p>O Lord God,<br />
Teach me to know that grace precedes,<br />
accompanies, and follows my salvation,<br />
that it sustains the redeemed soul,<br />
that not one link of it’s chain can ever break.<br />
From Calvary’s cross wave upon wave of grace<br />
reaches me,<br />
deals with my sin,<br />
washes me clean<br />
renews my heart,<br />
strengthens my will,<br />
draws out my affection,<br />
kindles a flame in my soul,<br />
rules throughout my inner man,<br />
consecrates my every thought, word, work,<br />
teaches me thy immeasurable love.<br />
How great are my privileges in Christ Jesus!<br />
Without him I stand far off, a stranger, an outcast;<br />
in him I draw near and touch his kingly scepter.<br />
Without him I dare no lift up my guilty eyes;<br />
in him I gaze upon my Father-God and Friend.<br />
Without him I hide my lips in trembling shame;<br />
in him I open my mouth in petition and praise.<br />
Without him all is wrath and consuming fire;<br />
in him is all love, and the repose of my soul.<br />
Without him is gaping hell below me, and eternal anguish<br />
in him its gates are barred to me by his precious blood.<br />
Without him darkness spreads its horrors in front;<br />
in him an eternity of glory is my boundless horizon.<br />
Without him all within me is terror and dismay;<br />
in him every accusation is charmed into joy and peace.<br />
Without him all things external call for my condemnation;<br />
in him they minster to my comfort,<br />
and are to be enjoyed with thanksgiving.<br />
Praise be to thee for grace,<br />
and for the unspeakable gift of Jesus.</p>
