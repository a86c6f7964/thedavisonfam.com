<p>I love reading friends blogs and I also love writing. Writing is a wonderful thing that helps me process thoughts and everything going on. There is something so beautiful about a string of words put together so eloquently . Though I am sure some of what I write will by no means be defined as eloquent. I am finally jumping on the blogging bandwagon to share all the things I am processing, the projects I am working on, and family updates as they occur.</p>
